			<h2><u>Y-DNA and Haplogroups</u></h2>
		</div>
		<div class="center">
			<h3><u>Y-DNA</u></h3>
			<div><p class="a"> Why DNA? No, Y-DNA. Well kind of both actually, why Y-DNA? Exactly, humans are given either XX DNA or XY DNA. A biological female is born with a pair of X chromosomes, whilst a biological male is born with XY chromosomes.
			What this simplified means is that females will always carry female DNA which is passed on through the generations. Whilst males will carry evidence in the DNA of both females and males. Although technically what happens is that because
			males carry XY DNA they also carry females DNA, so females can carry a males X female DNA passed down in the X chromosomes. Confusing? Well welcome to the world of DNA. Because females carry what is called mtDNA and males carry Y-DNA
			females carry maternal DNA and have those markers in the DNA males carry the paternal Y male DNA. So this study was chosen to look at Y DNA because of the fact that a males side carrys a single one of both male and females where as
			females do not. If this study had more time to evolve the study would include both X and Y DNA lineages from throughout history. Also because I am an amateur historian and genealogist I have a chance to study the data visualizations of
			of genetic lineages. In genealogy terms, the last name of most couples who decide to take the males last name history is easy to track through a constant 'family tree'. In all the sciences it easier to track constant variables back then
			it is to track or record random or sporadic variables.</p></div>
			<h3><u>Haplogroups</u></h3>
			<div><p class="b">Whilst trying to decide the simplest way of describing what a Haplogroup is and more to the point a Y-Haplogroup I came across a very easy to visualize definition from DNA-explained.com - "Everyone who tests their Y
			DNA at Family Tree DNA receives a haplogroup assignment. Think of a haplogroup as your genetic clan. Haplogroups have a history and a pedigree chart, just like people do. Haplogroups and their branches can identify certain groups of 
			people, such as people of African descent, European, Asian, Jewish and Native American." As I have paid much interest into my own genealogy, and having known my ancestry in the UK through my parents, grandparents and great grandparents 
			(actually further back than this by quite a why) I am mix of English, Irish, Scottish and we think some degree of Welsh I have been been fascinated in my own genetic lineage. I know from my brothers own ancestry test that I have a multitude
			of different ancestry, from northern Germanic, Viking, Briton Celtic, Irish Celtic, middle eastern Jewish and more I was interested in digging and discovering and creating visual data from genetic evidence in the UK.   
			By looking further back some aspect of the Y DNA can be analyzed called the 'Big Y'. This gives more specific details of not just 'countries and regions' but where the original Haplogroups came from so looking around post ice-age 
			and original settlements. These lead back to the Y-DNA 'Adam'. Symbolizing the original geo-location that the 'first' Y-DNA male came from. Source - https://dna-explained.com/2017/06/05/working-with-y-dna-your-dads-story/</p>
			<P>It is to be noted when viewing the pages that show DNA variables on a map in the Haplogroup Map sections that these can be referred to anytime when reading details on other pages and settler maps to reference the spread of the settlers in the UK and their Haplogroups.</P>
			<p>The Charts for the Haplogroup Maps on the menu at the top which starts usually 'countries haplogroup...' was personally designed, created and uploaded data by me to: https://www.datawrapper.de/. There is no use of other persons, companies or organizations visual material, just data accessed and collected by myself from other parties.</p>
